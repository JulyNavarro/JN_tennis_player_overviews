# JN_tennis_player_overviews
This jupyter notebook was one of the first assignments that I developed in my statistical techniques class.
I used Python code to show relevant statistical information about the data set selected.
This dataset refers to ATP World Tour tennis, in it, there are tennis data from the ATP World Tour website; for this assignment, I decided to choose to analyse rankings and players overview, so I will use the data file player_overviews_unindexed.

In the following links you can access the information of the variables used in this data set:
